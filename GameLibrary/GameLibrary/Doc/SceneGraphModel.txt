10 node types
    Geometry
    Transform
    Light
    Camera
    Particle System
    Switch
    LOD (Level Of Detail)
    Sound
    Marker
    Tracker
 
Defines the scene graph tree starting from its root node
Strict hierarchy
Only these nodes can have children
    - Geometry
    - Transform
    - Switch
    - LOD
    - Marker
    - Tracker
 
 Used by
    - Camera
    - Physics Engine
    - Network Server & Client
    - Rendering
    - ...
 
 
Geometry Node

Defines geometric model, material, and physical properties for physical simulation
Geometric Model
    - Model mesh
    - Shader for rendering the model
    - Bounding box
    - ...
Material
    - Diffuse color
    - Specular color
    - Specular power
    - Emissive color
    - Transparency
    - Texture
Physical Properties
    - Mass, Shape, ...
    - Pickable, Interactable, Collidable, IsVehicle,…
    - Linear/Angular Damping, Restitution, Friction,…
    - Initial Linear/Angular Velocity

Transform Node
Defines transformation of nodes with transform property
(Camera Node, Geometry Node, Light Node, Particle Node, Sound Node, LOD Node)
    - Scaling
    - Rotation
    - Translation
 
Transform nodes can be cascaded to compose transformations

Camera Node

Defines Eyepoint and View Frustum

Eyepoint
- Translation
- Rotation

View Frustum
- Near plane
- Far plane
- Aspect ratio
- Field of View [vertical]

 
Light Node

Defines illumination

Directional lights:
- Direction
- Diffuse color
- Specular color
- ...
